## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#673AB7) to convey professionalism and creativity. It's distinctive and memorable without being too flashy.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5). It is the same hue as violet, but greatly desaturated, for a clean and neutral backdrop that enhances readability.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688). Analogous to violet but with a shift towards green, teal is a complementary shade that enlivens the interface without overpowering it.
- Clean, sans-serif font for body text to ensure readability across all devices.
- A modern, grid-based layout to ensure responsiveness and visual balance.
- Use a set of professional icons to represent different skills and sections.
